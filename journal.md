# Title
Model-measurement comparison of biomass burning aerosol over West Africa

# Authors
John Smith Master, University of SomewhereElse
Jakob Jorgensen, University of Manchester

# Add reference to second paper.

# Simulations
John's box model is consistent with coagulation as the dominant growth mechanism.

# Methodology
We used a ToF-AMS to measure aerosol mass and composition (Smith et al 2001).

# Results
We report change in composition with atmospheric age. This is directly linked to the scattering poperties of the particles.

# Figures
This is a draft, so the figures fo in a section of their own.

# Conclusions
We did some science. It was great. More science needs to happen, so funding should be applied for.
